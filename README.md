# workout_randomiser
Mixing up the workout (every time!)

To do:
Randomiser for all other lists
Perhaps have it send a daily email that outputs the randomisation for today.
To start with - don't have if/or. Just have it spit out the randomisation for each and every list.
So have a function that runs over every body part and randomises, then does it for accessory, cable type, etc.
Then email it out.
After that I will make it more specific to the day?
